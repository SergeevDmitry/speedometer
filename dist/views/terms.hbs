        <p class="terms-description">
            When you use the BCB ATM website, these terms of use apply. Note that there are also terms of trade that apply when you register
            with BCB ATM. We also have a privacy policy that describes our privacy mission statement, how we use your
            data and our obligations to comply with appropriate rules and regulations that apply to the trading industry.
        </p>

        <h2 id="over">Overview</h2>
        <p>BCB ATM operates a website (referred to as "Website") that provides a service for buying and selling (trading)
            Bitcoins and Ether for both businesses and individuals. The terms of use form a legal agreement between BCB ATM
            and you, and by using the website you are indicating that you accept and understand the terms of use. Using
            the website by persons under the age of 13 is not permitted and if you are under the age of 16, or for any
            other reason do not understand the terms of use, do not use the website. The terms of use apply to all use
            of the website.
        </p>
        <p>BCB ATM is an online service operated by BCB ATM LIMITED. Occasionally we are required to update terms of use
            and by continuing to use the website, you are accepting the modified terms of use. We will notify you when
            there are important changes to the website and you should review the terms of use periodically to remain
            informed.
        </p>

            breached in any way. We may prevent trading, or prevent access at our discretion without limiting any other
            rights we have. If an account is cancelled or suspended, funds will be returned on request if there are no
            reasonable grounds to suspect criminal or fraudulent activity, such as money laundering.
